This plugin enables you to break a protocol message on an arbitrary position.
This is helpful when you have redundancy in your messages.

After enabling this plugin you will see a new action in the context menu of the message table in Analysis.
Note, this action is only available if you select a SINGLE message.
If you select multiple messages, the action will not appear in the context menu.
