The Universal Radio Hacker (URH) is a complete suite for wireless protocol investigation with native support for [many](https://github.com/jopohl/urh/wiki/Supported-devices) common __Software Defined Radios__.
URH allows __easy demodulation__ of signals combined with an [automatic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3375894.3375896) detection of modulation parameters making it a breeze to identify the bits and bytes that fly over the air. 
As data often gets _encoded_ before transmission, URH offers __customizable decodings__ to crack even sophisticated encodings like CC1101 data whitening.
When it comes to __protocol reverse-engineering__, URH is helpful in two ways. You can either manually assign protocol fields and message types or let URH __automatically infer protocol fields__ with a [rule-based intelligence](https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot19/presentation/pohl).
Finally, URH entails a __fuzzing component__ aimed at stateless protocols and a __simulation environment__ for stateful attacks.

### Getting started
In order to get started
 - view the [installation instructions](#Installation) on this page,
 - download the [official userguide (PDF)](https://github.com/jopohl/urh/releases/download/v2.0.0/userguide.pdf), 
 - watch the [demonstration videos (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuubkTDAxwA&index=1&list=PLlKjreY6G-1EKKBs9sucMdk8PwzcFuIPB),
 - check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jopohl/urh/wiki) for more information such as supported devices or
 - read some [articles about URH](#Articles) for inspiration.

## Installation
URH runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. See below for OS specific installation instructions.

### Windows
 On Windows, URH can be installed with its [Installer](https://github.com/jopohl/urh/releases). No further dependencies are required.
 
If you get an error about missing ```api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll```, run Windows Update or directly install [KB2999226](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows).

### Linux
#### Installation with pipx
URH is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/urh/) so you can install it, for example, with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/): 
```bash 
pipx install urh
``` 
This is the recommended way to install URH on Linux because it comes with __all native extensions__ precompiled.

In order to access your SDR as non-root user, install the according __udev rules__. You can find them [in the wiki](https://github.com/jopohl/urh/wiki/SDR-udev-rules).

#### Install via Package Manager
URH is included in the repositories of many linux distributions such as __Arch Linux__, __Gentoo__, __Fedora__, __openSUSE__ or __NixOS__. There is also a package for __FreeBSD__.  If available, simply use your package manager to install URH.

__Note__: For native support, you must install the according ```-dev``` package(s) of your SDR(s) such as ```hackrf-dev``` __before__ installing URH.

#### Docker Images
The official URH docker image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jopohl/urh/). It has all native backends included and ready to operate.

### macOS
#### Using DMG

It is recommended to use __at least macOS 10.14__ when using the DMG available [here](https://github.com/jopohl/urh/releases).

#### With brew
URH is available as a [homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/urh) so you can install it with
```commandline
brew install urh
```

### Running from source (OS-agnostic)
#### Without installation

To execute the Universal Radio Hacker without installation, just run:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/jopohl/urh/
cd urh/src/urh
./main.py
```

Note, before first usage the C++ extensions will be built.

#### Installing from source

To install URH from source you need to have ```python-setuptools``` installed. You can get them with ```python3 -m pip install setuptools```. 
Once the setuptools are installed execute: 
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/jopohl/urh/
cd urh
python setup.py install
```

And start the application by typing ```urh``` in a terminal.
